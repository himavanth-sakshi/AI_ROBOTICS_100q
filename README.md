# AI_ROBOTICS_100q
This repository, inspired by the AI Robotics 100Q Outline, offers a hands-on Python lab to showcase the key differences between traditional rule-based robotics and AI-powered robotics.

This repo is inspired by the [AI Robotics 100Q Outline](https://cybernachos.github.io/ai-robotics-100q/outline) and demonstrates the fundamental differences between traditional rule-based robotics and AI-powered robotics through hands-on Python code and visualization.

## Lab Overview

- **Traditional Rule-Based Robot**: Navigates using fixed if-else logic.
- **AI-Powered Robot**: Learns decision-making using a neural network.
- **Comparison & Visualization**: Clear output and charts to compare behaviors and performance.
